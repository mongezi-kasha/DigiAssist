# DigiAssist
Introduction

This application was conceptualized by an individual who, at the age of 24, experienced feelings of isolation and uncertainty. Motivated by personal experiences, the primary objective was to develop a virtual companion and mentor. The essence of the application is to provide a supportive presence akin to that of a friend or parental figure. Users have the capability to seek guidance across various aspects of their lives, encompassing professional, academic, and personal spheres. Notably, the app incorporates an innovative feature enabling users to record the voice of a cherished individual or mentor. Subsequently, whenever guidance is sought, advice is imparted through the app in the recorded voice of the selected individual, fostering a sense of familiarity and comfort. There will be an intergration with ChatGpt that will anable other daily need feature as reading your calendar to advise of coming appointments. Fot now this is just an experiment.
